# Basically, Full-stack GraphQL

This _fairly trivial_ project aims at introducing a newcomer to GraphQL and the way it works. The code aims to explain the client and the server side of things.

The source code has been heavily commented and documented in order to explain what's going on. It is highly recommended to read through it. Do _not_ be afraid!

## Getting Started

To run the example locally, simply clone the repo and run `yarn install`, then `yarn start`. The project will be accessible under `http://localhost:4000`. Be sure to inspect the network requests for more insights into how it all works.

Happy Coding! ðŸŽ‰
